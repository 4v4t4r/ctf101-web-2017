# Challenge 6

5cr1ptK1dd15s is calling for aspiring script writers to showcase their script-writing skills. Users can sign up for an account and publish their work on their page. Once you're done publishing your work, you can request for the admin to check and grade your entry.

My friend of mine has identified that the site is weak to XSS. Moreover, he just uploaded a malicious php file 'log.php' to the web server. I heard that the prize for publishing the best writeup is stored in the admin's profile page. Could you help me to get the prize? URL:3005
